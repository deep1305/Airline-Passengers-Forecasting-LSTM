# Airline-Passengers-Forecasting-LSTM
This project predicts future airline passenger numbers using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a powerful type of recurrent neural network well-suited for time series forecasting.

##Key Features:

###Data: Utilizes the AirPassengers dataset, containing historical passenger data.

###Preprocessing: Implements data cleaning, transformation, and scaling for optimal model training.

###LSTM Model: Builds and trains an LSTM model using TensorFlow and Keras.

###Evaluation: Assesses model performance using metrics like RMSE and MAE, comparing predictions against actual passenger numbers.

###Visualization: Provides clear visualizations of predictions, and their alignment.


Results:

The project includes visualizations of:

1. Model predictions vs. actual values

2. Model performance metrics (RMSE, MAE)


Future Work:

1. Experiment with different LSTM architectures and hyperparameters.
  
2. Incorporate additional features (e.g., economic indicators, seasonality) to improve prediction accuracy.

3. Deploy the model as a web application for interactive forecasting.
